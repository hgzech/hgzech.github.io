title: DT&#45;cut&#58; Dynamic tree cut
description: >
 DT&#45;Cut is a clustering tool based on hierarchical clustering.
 Rather than cutting the dendrogram at a specific threshold, it cuts based on a statistical test at each node.
 It uses a dynamic correction procedure to maintain a given famile wise error rate (bonferroni correction).
