My Github Page
=========================

I used the Jekyll theme "Freelancer" based on [Freelancer bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/).

I modified it because I didn't like the inline posts.
Instead there are now individual pages for each portfolio item.
Additionally, I added the academicons, to use the google scholar icon.
